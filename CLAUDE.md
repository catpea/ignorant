Self explanatory tests are located in ./test folder, each numbered sequentially. Tests are designed to be ran in order, when you repair the 001, move to 002, etc, otherwise the same bug/lack-of feature may cause unusual behaviour in later tests. You can run node --test to execute them all, but also each of the files is executable on their own and it is wiser to start at 001 rather than execute the entire test system.
